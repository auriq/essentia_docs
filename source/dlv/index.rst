Data Lake Viewer
****************

Your Essentia instance provides a web-based UI which we call the 'Data Lake Viewer'.  This service allows users to
quickly examine and categorize the files within their cloud based data stores.  It also allows SQL style queries on
raw data so that quick inspections and basic analysis of data can be performed without the need of first moving data
into another analysis platform.
