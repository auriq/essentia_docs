AQ Tools
--------
Unix users familiar with the raw text processing commands ``sed`` , ``awk``, etc should find the aq commands to be
relatively straightforward to learn.  This suite of tools can significantly ease the burden of many problems
encountered in a typical data processing workflow.


- :doc:`aqpp` : The heart of the package is the preprocessor, ``aq_pp``
- udb : The distributed, in memory, hash based database
- loginf : File content analyzer.  Determines many useful properties of the data.
- logconv : Log file converter
