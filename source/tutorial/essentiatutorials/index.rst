*****************
Essentia Tutorials
*****************

The following tutorials provide a solid background on most of Essentia's capabilities.  They do not require significant
computational resources, and therefore the AWS free tier of instances is sufficient to get
started. 

.. They can also be run on our Azure VM Image during the free trial period.

.. ===================

**Essentia Commands**

.. ===================

The first few tutorials aim to introduce the user to the Essentia commands that control connecting to, grouping, and streaming your data.

The manual for the Essentia commands is located here: :doc:`../../reference/manuals/essentia-ref`.

Examples of the syntax and options for the Essentia commands are located here: :doc:`../../usecases/syntaxexamples/essentia-3-examples-simple`.

Users are encouraged to go through the tutorials in order.
