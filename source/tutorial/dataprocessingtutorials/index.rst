Data Processing Tutorials
*************************

The following tutorials provide a solid background on most of Essentia's capabilities.  They do not require significant
computational resources, and therefore the AWS free tier of instances is sufficient to get
started. 

.. They can also be run on our Azure VM Image during the free trial period.

The manual for the Data Processing (AQ) commands is located here: :doc:`../../reference/manpages/index`.

Examples of the syntax and options for the Data Processing (AQ) commands are located here: :doc:`../../usecases/syntaxexamples/aq_pp-option-examples` and here: :doc:`../../usecases/syntaxexamples/aq_udb-option-examples`.

Users are encouraged to go through the tutorials in order.
