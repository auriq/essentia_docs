Intro Tutorials
***************

The following tutorials provide a solid background on most of Essentia's capabilities.  They do not require significant
computational resources, and therefore the desktop version or the AWS free tier of instances is sufficient to get
started. 

.. They can also be run on our Azure VM Image during the free trial period.


.. note::

  These tutorials assume you are using the ``bash`` shell.

Users are encouraged to go through the tutorials in order.
