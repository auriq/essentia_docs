Intro Tutorials
***************

The following tutorials provide a solid background on most of Essentia's capabilities.  They do not require significant
computational resources, and therefore the AWS free tier of instances is sufficient to get
started. 

.. They can also be run on our Azure VM Image during the free trial period.


.. note::

   These tutorials assume you are using the ``bash`` shell.

.. note::

   The Azure version does not support worker nodes.  A release in the near future will sync up all the capabilities of
   both the Azure and Amazon versions of Essentia.


Users are encouraged to go through the tutorials in order.
