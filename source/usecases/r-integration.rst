Essentia R Integration
********************

Explore, Preprocess, and Shrink Your Big Data for Easy Loading and Analysis in R

Features:
---------------------------------------

**Make Use of Big Data**

* Essentia can handle any text-based, delimited data.  It doesn't matter if your data is clean or dirty, compressed or uncompressed, zip or gzip. Essentia handles the big data crunching and loads the resulting data into its parallelized database. 
* You can easily query this database and only store the results of those queries in your R dataframes, letting you focus your efforts on gaining insights in your R analyses.

**Scan and ETL**

* Scan and understand your files, create simple rules to categorize your files, and select exactly the data you want. Then easily pipe your data into our powerful and easy-to-use ETL tool to cleanse, transform, and merge as you see fit. 
* Essentia easily cleans and converts any type of delimited log into a format easily read into an R dataframe.

**Drive Analysis**

* As Essentia streams your data into its database, it can easily apply attributes to the data and group the data by its unique values. 
* Essentia makes it easy to provide unique counts and similar analyses so your R analysis can be that much more efficient. 
* With Essentia and R together, Big Data turns into actionable insights with minimal effort and maximum amazement.

A Typical Process
--------------------

**Scan S3**

Using our scanner you can easily select the data you want from your S3 repository or local files. Essentia makes it easy to preprocess the data as you see fit and stream the modified data directly into R.

**Easy Integration**

For example you can ETL your data to cut out any unwanted columns and eliminate any erroneous records and then load the output directly into a data frame in R. By simply telling the integration script which file holds your essentia preprocessing steps and which file holds your R analysis, you can:

* Stream the data directly from S3 or local files
* Preprocess with essentia and condense the data into various counts and simple analyses
* Run more advanced statistical analysis in R

Bring Your Big Data Into R's Reach
-----------------------------------
Essentia's expert selection, merge, and parallelization abilities make it the perfect fit to extend R into the regime of big data. With a single R script, you can now stream terabytes of data directly through essentia's preprocessor and into your R analysis.

Essentia's versatility and experience with big data, combined with the advanced statistical analysis inherent to R, provides exciting opportunities. 

See one such opportunity for yourself with our `Apache Log Analysis <http://www.auriq.net/documentation/source/usecases/apache.html>`_, or if you want to start using Essentia and R now see `Getting Started with the R Integrator <http://www.auriq.net/documentation/source/usecases/r-format-requirements.html>`_.
